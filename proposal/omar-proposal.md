## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**

The Covid wiki is going to be a one stop shop for all info relating to corona virus. It will have information based off the virus, possibly show where to get tested, show current news for the virus, and show the live tracking website of the virus to keep people informed. Due to the heavy spread of misinformation, all info on this website will come from trusted sources and used soley to inform people about the truth.

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
Writing out this project in node.JS, which is a language I havent used in a while. as well as finding accurate information to display on the website. 

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

Navigate between news articles.

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 
Wiki info for Covid-19, symptoms, how to stay safe, what to do and how to donate. Possibly set an area to give donations to help people in affected areas.

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 
Where to get tested, at first users will input a location they know they can get tested at.
